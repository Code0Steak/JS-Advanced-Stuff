/*

    Typescript is a superset of JS.
    It is a strongly typed language which provides effecient tooling 🛠(The TSC) to detect bugs at compile time.
    This helps us to write more predictable code.
    There is no learning curve as every JS code is valid in TS ╰(*°▽°*)╯
    It helps us to write code with future JS features, so stays always updated!!

    The TSC compiler by-default converts any TS code to ES3 🙆🏼‍♂️
