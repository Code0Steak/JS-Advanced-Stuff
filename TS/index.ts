/*

    Typescript is a superset of JS. 
    It is a strongly typed language which provides effecient tooling 🛠(The TSC) to detect bugs at compile time. 
    This helps us to write more predictable code.
    There is no learning curve as every JS code is valid in TS ╰(*°▽°*)╯
    It helps us to write code with future JS features, so stays always updated!!

//The async function below is not supported by ES3 and is transpiled to a weired function 
async function hello(){

//So we added, the tsconfig.json file, with some instructions!!
/*

    In the compilerOptions object in the tsconfig.json file, we added fields:
    1. "target" : "esnext", so that the code always transpiles to the latest supported ver. of JS
    2. "watch" : true, so that after every save the index.TS will be transpiled to index.js
    3. "lib" : ["dom","es2017"], to access all the latest supported dom API's.
