    > Note:
    > The tsconfig.json file contains compilerOptions object with fields:
    > 1. "target" : "esnext", so that the code always transpiles to the latest supported ver. of JS
    > 2. "watch" : true, so that after every save the index.TS will be transpiled to index.js
    > 3. "lib" : ["dom","es2017"], to access all the latest supported dom API's.
